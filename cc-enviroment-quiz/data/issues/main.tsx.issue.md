main.tsx
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
```error
Property 'render' does not exist on type 'typeof import(
```
The error message you're encountering, "Property 'render' does not exist on type 'typeof import(...)", typically indicates that the `ReactDOM` module is not being imported correctly or that the version of ReactDOM you are using has changed its API.

As of React 18, the `ReactDOM.render` method has been replaced with `ReactDOM.createRoot` for rendering applications. Here's how you can update your `main.tsx` file to use the new API:

```tsx
// import React from 'react';  // This Part ia now taken out.
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; // Note the change here
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement); // Ensure the element is not null
root.render(<App />);
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Import from `react-dom/client`:** In React 18, you need to import from `react-dom/client` instead of `react-dom`.
2. **Use `createRoot`:** Instead of `ReactDOM.render`, you now use `ReactDOM.createRoot` to create a root and then call `root.render` to render your application.
3. **Type Assertion:** The `document.getElementById('root')` may return `null`, so you can use a type assertion (`as HTMLElement`) to inform TypeScript that you expect this element to exist.

Make sure you have the correct version of React and ReactDOM installed in your project. You can check your `package.json` or run the following command to install the latest versions:

```bash
npm install react react-dom
```

After making these changes, your application should work without the error.
