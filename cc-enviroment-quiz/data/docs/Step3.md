### Steps to Run the Containers

1. **Navigate to the Root Directory**: Open your terminal and change to the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

2. **Build and Start the Services**: Run the following command to build and start both the Flask and React applications:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the Applications**:
   - For the **Flask app**, open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`
   - For the **React quiz app**, go to: `http://localhost:3000`

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Check Docker Installation**: Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running on your machine.

- **View Logs**: If you encounter issues, you can view the logs for each service by running:
  ```sh
  docker-compose logs
  ```
  This will help you identify any errors in the startup process.

- **Rebuild Containers**: If you make changes to your Dockerfiles or dependencies, you may need to rebuild the containers. Use:
  ```sh
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

- **Environment Variables**: Make sure your `.env` file is correctly set up and that any necessary environment variables are being loaded.

- **Network Issues**: If you have issues accessing the applications, check if there are any firewall rules or network settings that might be blocking access to the specified ports.

- **Container Status**: You can check the status of your containers with:
  ```sh
  docker-compose ps
  ```

### Additional Enhancements

- **Health Checks**: Consider adding health checks in your `docker-compose.yml` to ensure that your services are running as expected.

- **Volume Mounting**: If you want to persist data or make development easier, you can mount volumes for your application code.

- **Production Configuration**: When moving to production, consider using a production-ready server for Flask (like Gunicorn) and optimizing your React build.
