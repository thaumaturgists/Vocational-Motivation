# Flask Application Overview

This document outlines the structure and functionality of the Flask application, highlighting key components, recent changes, and their rationale.

## Key Components

### 1. Imports
```python
import logging
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_debugtoolbar import DebugToolbarExtension
from flask_cors import CORS
import json
```
- **Flask**: The core framework for building the web application.
- **jsonify**: Used to create JSON responses.
- **request**: To handle incoming requests.
- **CORS**: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **DebugToolbarExtension**: Provides a debugging toolbar for development.
- **json**: For loading quiz data from a JSON file.

### 2. Application Setup
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)
```
- Initializes the Flask application and enables CORS to allow requests from different origins.

### 3. Debug Toolbar Configuration
```python
app.config['DEBUG'] = True  # Enable debug mode
app.config['DEBUG_TB_INTERCEPT_REDIRECTS'] = False  # Disable redirect interception
toolbar = DebugToolbarExtension(app)  # Initialize the Debug Toolbar
```
- **Debug Mode**: Enables detailed error messages and debugging information.
- **Redirect Interception**: Disabling this allows the toolbar to display correctly during redirects.

### 4. Logging Configuration
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
```
- Configures logging to capture debug-level messages with timestamps, aiding in tracking application behavior.

### 5. Routes
#### Root Route
```python
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Creation Profile Cards App is Running!"
```
- Returns a simple message indicating that the application is running.

#### Health Check Route
```python
@app.route('/health')
def health():
    return jsonify({"status": "healthy"})
```
- Provides a health check endpoint to verify that the application is operational.

#### Profile Creation Route
```python
@app.route('/api/profile', methods=['POST'])
def create_profile():
    try:
        data = request.json
        if data is None:
            app.logger.error("No JSON data provided")
            return jsonify({"error": "No JSON data provided"}), 400
        app.logger.info(f"Received data: {data}")
        return jsonify({"message": "Profile created", "data": data}), 201
    except Exception as e:
        app.logger.error(f"Error occurred: {str(e)}")
        return jsonify({"error": "Something went wrong"}), 500
```
- Handles POST requests to create a profile. It logs the received data and returns appropriate responses based on the request's validity.

#### Quiz Data Route
```python
@app.route('/api/quiz', methods=['GET'])
def get_quiz():
    with open('questions.json') as f:
        quiz_data = json.load(f)
    return jsonify(quiz_data)
```
- Loads quiz questions from a JSON file and returns them as a JSON response.

### 6. Error Handling
```python
@app.errorhandler(400)
def bad_request(error):
    return jsonify({"error": "Bad Request"}), 400
```
- Custom error handler for 400 Bad Request errors, providing a structured JSON response.

### 7. Running the Application
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)  # Ensured compatibility with Docker networking
```
- Runs the application on all available IP addresses, making it accessible from other devices on the network.

## Dockerfile Overview
```dockerfile
# Base image for Python
FROM python:alpine@sha256:18159b2be11db91f84b8f8f655cd860f805dbd9e49a583ddaac8ab39bf4fe1a7

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Add author information
LABEL maintainer="Connor (https://github.com/thaumaturgists/)"

# Copy requirements.txt and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt || { echo "Failed to install Python dependencies"; exit 1; }

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 5000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
- **Base Image**: Uses a lightweight Python image for the application.
- **Working Directory**: Sets the working directory for the application.
- **Dependency Installation**: Installs required Python packages from `requirements.txt`.
- **Copying Application Code**: Copies the application code into the container.
- **Port Exposure**: Exposes port 5000 for the application, allowing external access.
- **Command to Run the Application**: Specifies the command to start the Flask application when the container runs.

## Requirements File
```plaintext
pytest
flask
flask-debugtoolbar
flask-cors
flask-sqlalchemy
flask-migrate
flask-restful
requests
```
- **Dependencies**: Lists the required Python packages for the application:
  - **pytest**: For testing the application.
  - **flask**: The core framework for building the web application.
  - **flask-debugtoolbar**: For debugging during development.
  - **flask-cors**: To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
  - **flask-sqlalchemy**: For database interactions.
  - **flask-migrate**: For handling database migrations.
  - **flask-restful**: For building RESTful APIs.
  - **requests**: For making HTTP requests.

## Quiz Questions JSON Structure
```json
{
    "questions": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "question": "What is the capital of France?",
        "options": ["Berlin", "Madrid", "Paris", "Rome"],
        "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
        "exp": "Paris is the capital of France, known for its art, fashion, and landmarks like the Eiffel Tower."
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "question": "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?",
        "options": ["Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Venus"],
        "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
        "exp": "Mars is called the Red Planet due to its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface."
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "question": "Who wrote 'Hamlet'?",
        "options": ["Charles Dickens", "William Shakespeare", "Jane Austen", "Leo Tolstoy"],
        "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
        "exp": "William Shakespeare wrote 'Hamlet', one of his most famous tragedies about the Prince of Denmark."
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "question": "What is the largest ocean on Earth?",
        "options": ["Atlantic Ocean", "Indian Ocean", "Pacific Ocean", "Arctic Ocean"],
        "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
        "exp": "The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean, covering more than 63 million square miles."
      },
      {
        "id": 5,
        "question": "What is the chemical symbol for gold?",
        "options": ["Au", "Ag", "Fe", "Pb"],
        "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
        "exp": "Gold is represented by the chemical symbol 'Au', which comes from its Latin name 'Aurum'."
      }
    ]
}
```
- **Structure**: The JSON structure contains an array of quiz questions, each with:
  - **id**: A unique identifier for the question.
  - **question**: The text of the question.
  - **options**: An array of possible answers.
  - **correctAnswerIndex**: The index of the correct answer in the options array.
  - **exp**: An explanation of the correct answer.

## Summary

The Flask application has been enhanced with several key features and improvements, including:

- Integration of the Flask Debug Toolbar for better debugging capabilities.
- Addition of a health check route to monitor application status.
- Dynamic loading of quiz questions from a JSON file.
- Improved error handling and structured responses for better user experience.
- A well-defined Dockerfile for easy deployment and containerization.
- A comprehensive `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies.

These changes contribute to a more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly application, setting a solid foundation for future development and enhancements.
