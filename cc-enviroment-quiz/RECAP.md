To start Docker using Docker Compose in a specific folder, you typically follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Folder**: Open your terminal and change to the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located. You can do this using the `cd` command. For example:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/folder
   ```

2. **Run Docker Compose**: Once you're in the correct directory, you can start your services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file by running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will start the containers as defined in your Docker Compose file. If you want to run it in detached mode (in the background), you can add the `-d` flag:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Stopping the Services**: To stop the services, you can run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system before running these commands.

# So now I should be able to turn it off?

Yes, you can turn off the Docker services that you started with Docker Compose. To do this, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Same Folder**: If you're not already in the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located, navigate to it using the `cd` command.

2. **Stop the Services**: Run the following command to stop and remove the containers defined in your Docker Compose file:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

This command will stop all the running containers and remove them, along with any networks created by Docker Compose. If you want to stop the services without removing the containers, you can use:
```bash
docker-compose stop
```

After running these commands, your Docker services will be turned off.

# and it wont have to redownload?

No, if you run `docker-compose up` again after stopping the services, it will not redownload the images unless there have been changes to the `docker-compose.yml` file or the images themselves have been updated in the repository.

Here's how it works:

- **Existing Images**: If the images are already present on your system, Docker Compose will use those existing images to start the containers. It won't redownload them unless you explicitly tell it to do so.

- **Pulling New Images**: If you want to ensure that you have the latest version of the images, you can use the `--pull` option with the `up` command:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --pull
  ```

- **Rebuilding Images**: If you have made changes to the Dockerfile or the context of the build, you can rebuild the images using:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

In summary, running `docker-compose up` will start the containers using the existing images without redownloading them, unless you specify otherwise.
